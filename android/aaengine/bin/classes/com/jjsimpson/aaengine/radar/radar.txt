This is used to map immediate environment.
Origin is the center, later it needs to be mapped to fit with others.
Origin should have GPS location and adjusted Offset, but it will need to be adjusted later on
This will contain an array of points, each point will be in x, y, coordinate. Each point will be a boundry, or unended.
A radar needs a min of 4 points at 90 degrees. There should be a compass, so they can be in the correct place.

There should be two types of radar. A min radar (used to find a place in a map), and a full radar (used to create a map).

TODO
Need to create radar map. Where getting distance, and angle? and creating point type
